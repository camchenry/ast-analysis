# AST Analysis Tool

Copilot wrote basically of this code because I was feeling lazy and I just wanted to know about the frequency of AST node types in typical JS codebases. There is nothing special about this code really, it's just a quick analysis on node frequencies. This information will help inform the development in `oxc`, as we can optimize around which node types are the most common.

If just want to see the results, look at `analysis.txt`, or any repository in the `analysis` directory.

To install and use:

```bash
npm install
npm run analyze <directory>
```

Example output:

```

There is also a script to download some popular repositories for testing:

```bash
npm run download-repos
```

and then analyze all of them:

```bash
npm run analyze-all
```
